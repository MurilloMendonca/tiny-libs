# Tiny Libs

Just a bunch of simple quality-of-life libraries in C and may some wrappers in C++.

Just to learn more and practice Data Structures, don't expect std level libraries from this, but be welcome to use it if you need some simple and easily customizable structures.

All C code is compiled with the C89 standard for maximum compatibility, and all C++ code with C++17 (for now, maybe).

# Compile
Read the Makefile and run it if you want.

# Use the libs

Read the tests/demos and the code itself.

# Documentation

The code.
